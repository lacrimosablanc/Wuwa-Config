# Wuwa-Config
Ultra high + optimization
Based on https://github.com/Arglax/WuWa-Config
This config is further optimized for My device which is Lenovo Legion y700 4th gen. I notice after a recent update, the fps got tanked down to 40 during intense fight. This config specially reduce skill particle. Reduce grass density and foliage distance to maintain 60fps throughput Septimont exploration.
